Wricha's Somatosensory cortex Model adapted from the BBP 2015 and NetPyNE's version of the BBP
Added features: 
1. Cell specific Muscarinic m-current modulation 
2. Cell specific modulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration
3. Cell specific Calcium activated SK channel modulation 

Capacity to run specific subpopulations and scaled-down versions of the NetPyNE S1 model (Borges, F. S., Moreira, J. V. S., Takarabe, L. M., Lytton, W. W., & Dura-Bernal, S. (2022). Large-scale biophysically detailed model of somatosensory thalamocortical circuits in NetPyNE)
